        "I regret nothing, ever.",
        "Here you are just thinking Jackie's not good enough to be a pirate, why can't he be more like his cousin Valerie, or Grandmama...",
        "So, your ability to remain free resides in the hands of a rum trafficker smitten with the drink.",
        "He who wins the day must buy the drinks. It's traditional.",
        "How odd. Must have words with that first mate of mine. Bit of a loose cannon, he is.",

        "But you have heard of me.",
        "Monkey!",
        "You seem somewhat familiar. Have I threatened you before?",
        "Do us a favor... I know it's difficult for you... but please, stay here, and try not to do anything... stupid.",
        "Of the two of us, I am the only one who hasn't committed mutiny, therefore my word is the one we'll be trusting.",

        "My eyesight's as good as ever, just so you know.",
        "You're hired!",
        "Ah-ha! So, we've established my proposal as sound in principle. Now, we're just haggling over price.",
        "Shhh.",
        "One word love: curiosity. You long for freedom. You long to do what you want to do because you want it.",
        "'Ello, beastie.",
        "So what's your plan, then?",

        "Captain Jack Sparrow.",
        "My compass is unique.",
        "If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever it is we don't have that it unlocks.",

        "I want my jar of dirt!",
        "'Ello beastie.",
        "Did everyone see that? Because I will *not* be doing it again.",
        "There'll be dangers along the way... firstly mermaids, zombies... Blackbeard.",
        "You've stolen me. And I'm here to take meself back.",
        "I gotta go.",
        "Seeing as how you're still alive, I say it's all been very successful thus far.",
        "Doesn't ring a bell.",
        "That is NOT a compliment.",

        "Death lies before us, as we sail to the Fountain of Youth.",
        "The ship is ours!",
        "Captain, I wish to report a mutiny. I can name fingers and point names.",
        "Your father saved you. Perhaps his soul is now redeemed.",
        "What has become of my Pearl?",

        "I once sailed with a geezer lost both his arms and part of his eye.",
        "I leave you people alone for just a minute and look what happens, everything's gone to pot!",
        "My peanut!",
        "We shall have a magnificent garden party, and you're not invited!",
        "Drink up, me hearties, yo ho!",
        "You may throw my hat if you wish.",
        "You add an agreeable sense of the macabre to any delirium.",

        "Now we're being followed by rocks. Never had that one before.",
        "My hands are clean in this, figuratively.",
        "I haven't the face for tentacles. But, immortality has to count for something, eh?",
